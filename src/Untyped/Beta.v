(**
  Beta reduction amounts to taking a term of the form
  [(lambda x . b) t] and producing [[x:=t]b]. If the term given
  is not of this form, then return the term. In this manner, it
  acts like the identity.
*)

Fixpoint Beta (t:Term) : Term :=
  match t with
  | App (Lam body) t' => [(BId 0):=t']body
  | App t' t'' => match (Beta t') with
                  | (Lam body) => [(BId 0):=t'']body
                  | _ as r' => r'
                  end
  | _ => t
  end.

Example i_combinator_is_identity :
  forall (t : Term),
  Beta (App Combinator.I t) = t.
Proof.
  (* unfold the definitions, then apply Id equality *)
  intuition.
  unfold Beta; unfold Combinator.I; unfold subst; apply eq_id.
Qed.

(** Definition. A term is in Beta Normal Form iff it doesn't have any
    subterms of the form [App (lambda x. body) R]. *)
Fixpoint BetaNF (M:Term) : Prop :=
  match M with
  | BVar _ => True
  | FVar _ => True
  | Lam body => BetaNF body
  | App (Lam _) _ => False
  | App M' N => (BetaNF M')/\(BetaNF N)
  end.

(** What expression wouldn't be in Beta normal form? One that would never
    terminate. For example, the [Combinator.Omega] evaluates to itself after
    beta reduction, so if we tried repeatedly beta reducing...we'll end up in
    an infinite loop. Which may be bad.
*)
Example Omega_combinator_isnt_beta_nf :
  ~(BetaNF Combinator.Omega).
Proof.
  intros.

  unfold Combinator.Omega; (* Unfold the definitions *)
  unfold Combinator.omega;
  unfold BetaNF.

  simpl; tauto. (* And it's obvious. *)
Qed.

(** * Values

We would like to think of Beta reduction as one step in an abstract
"processor". A value would be where the Beta reduction would stop after
finitely many steps. So we'll just take [BetaNF] as the criteria for
determining if a [Term] is a value or not.
*)
Definition value (t:Term) : Prop := BetaNF t.
Hint Unfold value.

(** * Small-Step Operational Semantics

We can explicitly state the rules for our "abstract processor".
